# semantic-collaborative-filtering
Hybrid collaborative filtering for grade prediction, considering the semantic representation of the courses.

## Roadmap
- [x] Architect our first CF model variant.
- [ ] Clean the code. Make it a reusable repository.
- [ ] Write suitable `README.md`
- [ ] Write a version with BERT encoding of the sentence description instead of the average of word vectors
- [ ] Read some previous works on collaborative filtering which consider the semantic similarity of courses
- [ ] Architect a (neural?) model which can be better optimized with more data
- [ ] Quantitatively analyze the new model
